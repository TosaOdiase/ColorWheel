App Improvement Idea 

 I would like to implement a feature to Uber that allows the passenger to dictate what music will be played during their trip before they even enter the vehicle. The Uber Comfort feature that alerady exists on the app asks the user to dictate the temperature and overall noise for their drive before they call the Uber. So, this feature I'd like to implement would ask a user that is getting an Uber Comfort ride if they would like to connect their Uber account to their Apple Music or Spotify account and once these accounts are connected, Uber can ask if you would like a certain playlist to be shuffled during your card ride. Once the user chooses the playlist they want to play, the uber driver will receive the playlist on their Spotify/Apple Music app and play it in their car once they pick you up. This works very similar to Airbuds which allows you to view the type of music another user listens to and then play that music for yourself. But, in this case, the driver is playing your taste of music in order to optimixe your passenger experience.
 
## Notes

My biggest challenge was debugging. I had accidentally assigned my changeColor button to an IBOutlet instead of IBAction.
